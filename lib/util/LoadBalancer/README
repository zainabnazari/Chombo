The loadBalancer utility is a standalone interface to the Chombo load balancing
functions which may be called in serial or in parallel.  Code takes an inputs 
file which is processed using ParmParse in the usual way (prefix is "main").
Example inputs files provided are "inputs.2d.2Proc" and "inputs.3d.2Proc" 
which take the grids in "testGrids.2d" and "testGrids.3d" respectively, 
distribute them among two processors, then write the resulting grids and 
associated processor assignments out to "testGrids.2d.2Proc" and "testGrids.3d.2Proc" respectively.

The input and output grid files use the same format as is read by the 
AMRPoisson example code.
